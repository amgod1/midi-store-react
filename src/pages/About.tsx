        In 1992, O’Donnell purchased a company then known as Numark Electronics, a small DJ equipment manufacturer that had been around since the early 70s. Numark has since revolutionized the art of DJing by introducing new technologies and cutting-edge products and is now the largest DJ equipment manufacturer in the world. Numark’s transformation turned out to be a prototype for a long string of similar successes.

        In 2001, O’Donnell purchased Alesis, the groundbreaking company with a history of making innovative technology accessible to every musician. Alesis was the first to make studio-quality digital effects and recording affordable to the masses. Today, Alesis is the fastest growing electronic drum company in the world and continues to make tools and instruments that empower everyday musicians.

        In 2002, O’Donnell ventured into the notoriously competitive Consumer Electronics Industry with the creation of ION Audio and its flagship product, the USB conversion turntable. It was a huge success. ION has gone on to create products that energize entertainment, harness and simplify technology, and make learning a musical instrument fun and easy.

        In 2005, returning to the turnaround trend, O’Donnell purchased another iconic brand: Akai Professional, one of the world’s most influential manufacturers of music production gear and creator of the legendary MPC. Harnessing the power of advancing technology, Akai Professional’s production tools remain staples of modern music both in the studio and on stage.

        In 2007, MixMeister was acquired, adding the first dedicated software company to the group and foreshadowing things to come. From very early on, O’Donnell recognized the implications of the Digital Revolution for music-making and began gearing each brand’s product offerings accordingly through strategic partnerships and the targeting of future acquisitions.

        In 2010, Alto Professional, a little-known live sound company based in Italy, was added to the group and has since become a leader in live sound reinforcement, adopting the same intense spirit of innovation that pervades each inMusic brand.

        2017 saw inMusic create a brand-new company called HeadRush. We listened to the world’s top guitarists who told us they needed gear that effortlessly worked with them to enhance their creative musical efforts. “Conventional” wouldn’t do. Our initial product, the HeadRush Pedalboard, is a guitar FX and Amp Modeling Processor in an easy-to-use Pedalboard platform. Finally, for guitarists, “Your perfect tone is just a touch away.”
